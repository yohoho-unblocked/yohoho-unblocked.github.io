Swing back and forth to build momentum, then release to launch. Dodge the obstacles and get past the finish line!</p><h3>Swing Monkey Tips &amp; Tricks</h3><h4>Bounce to the finish</h4><p>Among the obstacles are trampolines you can use to spring off of and gain speed. The air time from the trampolines won’t last very long, so make sure to grab on to a ring as soon as possible!</p><h4>Know when to let go</h4><p>You can apply the basic principles of motion in order to get the most speed. The more you swing back and forth, the more speed you’ll build up. Release your rope at the right time for maximum air.&nbsp;</p><h4>Ride the wind</h4><p>If you swing or bounce high enough, you’ll be able to soar through most of the course without grabbing onto any rings. Gather as much speed as you can at the start of the level to make flying through the obstacles a breeze.&nbsp;</p><h4>Learn from your mistakes</h4><p>Oftentimes after people will fail a level, they will get frustrated and start blindly swinging from vine to vine hoping they get lucky. While this may work during the earlier levels, the later levels will not be so forgiving. Instead, ask yourself why you failed the level and what you could have done differently. This learning mentality will have you progressing through difficult levels much quicker than you might think.&nbsp;</p><h3>What you learn from playing Swing Monkey</h3><p>Playing Swing Monkey is a good way to apply basic physics to gameplay. The game’s mechanics can help players learn and understand the process of energy conversion. By applying knowledge of energy principles, players can calculate the right time to let go based on the amount of speed built up when swinging.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention, it’s also just a ton of fun. Swing Monkey puts a great twist on classic puzzle games by adding timing and physics to them.

A couple of games that we recommend are Candy Jump and Winter Dodge. Both are based on using your momentum and controlling your distance.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, what are you waiting for?
